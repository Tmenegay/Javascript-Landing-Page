            <li> The throw keyword generates a custom error.</li>
            <li> A ReferenceError occurs when a variable does not exist, a TypeError occurs when the variable exists but the operation you're trying to perform is not appropriate for the type of value it contains.</li>
            <li> My approach of debugging the Javascript code was to run through the console by pressing f12 then checking for syntax errors</li>
            <li> So far I have mainly just had a couple syntax errors, and a few run time errors</li>
            <li> I would say that in my time debugging it has helped me to become a more methodical programmer</li>
